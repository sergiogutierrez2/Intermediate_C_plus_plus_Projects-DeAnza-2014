"For testing in this assignment, after building the car object, the buildCar function calls the output member function for the Car." 

void buildCar (string reportingMark2, int carNumber2, string kind2, bool loaded2, string destination2)

{
  Car X (reportingMark2, carNumber2, kind2, loaded2, destination2);
  X.output();
}

"Then modify the input function so it calls the buildCar function to build the car, rather than building the car in the input function." 
So, this should be in main:
buildCar (reportingMark, carNumber, kind, loaded, destination);
right?

The kind of cars for the three classes will be:
Car:   business, maintenance, other
FreightCar:   box, tank, flat, otherFreight
PassengerCar:   chair, sleeper, otherPassenger 

"In the global area define an enum named Kind, with the following values in this order: business, maintenance, other, box, tank, flat, otherFreight, chair, sleeper, otherPassenger"
I thought he wasn't going to include enums -.- 
These aren't in our quarter program. 

enum Kind {business, maintenance, other, box, tank, flat, otherFreight, chair, sleeper, otherPassenger} 

"Also in the global area define an array of const string objects named KIND_ARRAY.It will contain strings with the same text as the names of the values in the enum, in the same order. "

const int NUM_SUBSCRIPTS = 10;
string KIND_ARRAY[NUM_SUBSCRIPTS] = {"business", "maintenance", "other", "box", "tank", "flat", "otherFreight", "chair", "sleeper", "otherPassenger"};

Revise the main function to call the input function and do nothing else. 

main ()
{
input();
}
